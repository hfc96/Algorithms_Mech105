# Details
This code is used to find the root of a function using the false position method.

# Code Format
I = Simpson(x,y)

## Inputs
x is the generated evenly spaced evaluation points  
y is the function values at those evaluation points

## Outputs
I is the result of applying the simpson's method

## Errors & Adjustments
x and y must be the same length vectors  
x must be evenly spaced, as if generated by linspace  
if the number of points does not allow a complete use of Simpsons method (even number of evaluation points), the trapezoidal rule is used for the last interval.
